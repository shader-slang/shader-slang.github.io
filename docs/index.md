## Tutorials

#### [Write your first slang shader](/docs/first-slang-shader)
See how to write a simple compute shader in Slang and compile it for execution on Vulkan.

#### [Using the compilation API](/slang/user-guide/compiling)
See how to use Slang's compilation API to integrate the Slang compiler into your application.

#### [Using the reflection API](/slang/user-guide/reflection)
See how to use Slang's reflection API to query for parameter binding info at runtime.

#### Understanding Slang Generics

Learn how to use Slang's generics and interfaces to write structured code that can be
specialized at compile time. This tutorial covers the differences between generics and C++ templates
and how to map common templated code to generics.
