We know it: many developers that are just getting started with Slang find themselves daunted by the reflection API. During this meet-up we will explain the underlying mental model for how Slang reflects shader code and show specific code examples for how to use the reflection API to access the information that developers most often need. Along the way we will call out caveats and pitfalls that we‚Äôve seen bite developers before.

### Prerequisites

This will be a practical nuts-and-bolts presentation that assumes attendees already have experience with GPU shader programming and the Vulkan API. Prior experience with the Slang reflection API and the features of the Slang language will be beneficial but is not required

### Speaker

- Theresa Foley, NVIDIA
