Tired of wrestling with preprocessor macros and copy-pasting shader code? Discover how Slang's modern module system can revolutionize your shader development workflow!
 
Join us for an introductory talk where we'll explore:
 
#### Modules & Visibility Control
- Learn how to organize your shader code into clean, reusable modules with proper access control (public, internal, private) that actually makes sense.  
<br>

#### Compilation Pipeline Magic
- See how modules enable separate compilation, and how that translates to faster compile times when you need to compile many different shader variants specialized from the same source code.  
<br>

#### Specialization Without Preprocessor Pain
- Discover how Slang's language features let you specialize shaders at link-time without the mess of #ifdef spaghetti. Write cleaner, more maintainable code that works synergistically with modules and separate compilation.  
<br> 

#### Generics vs Templates: The Slang Way
- Understand the difference between Slang's type-safe generics and C++ templates, and why Slang generics is the key to allow true separate compilation.  
<br>
 
Whether you're building a rendering engine or just want to write better shaders, this talk will show you how Slang modules can make your code more modular, faster to compile, and easier to maintain. Perfect for developers looking to move beyond traditional HLSL workflows!

### Prerequisites

No prior Slang experience required - we'll start from the basics and build up to practical examples you can use immediately.

### Speaker

- Yong He, NVIDIA
