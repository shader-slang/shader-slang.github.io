Great news: Slang support is now officially available on [Godbolt Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/z/193GxYrn6)!
 
Godbolt Compiler Explorer is a widely-used online tool that allows developers to write code in various programming languages and see the resulting assembly code in real-time. This powerful resource helps users understand how high-level code translates to lower-level instructions, making it an invaluable educational and debugging tool. For Slang, this provides an avenue for viewing the SPIR-V, HLSL, GLSL, WGSL, or other output for a given Slang program directly in a compiler explorer tool which may already be familiar to you.

The Slang team is very grateful to the efforts of LunarG engineer Spencer Fricke in integrating Slang support to the Compiler Explorer!
