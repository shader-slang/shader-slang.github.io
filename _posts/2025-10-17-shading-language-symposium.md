## Shading Language Symposium

This ground-breaking Shading Language Symposium brings together shading language implementors, developers, researchers and technical artists to explore the future of shading languages and real-time rendering technologies.

The symposium will focus on the evolving landscape of shading languages and the emerging technologies that are shaping the next generation of graphics programming.

If you work with Shading Languages then this event will provide a unique opportunity to connect with your peers, learn from leaders in their fields, and advance your expertise.

The Symposium is organised by the Khronos Group and will take place immediately after [Vulkanised 2026](https://vulkan.org/events/vulkanised-2026). We value a diversity of voices, perspectives and experiences and are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone.
