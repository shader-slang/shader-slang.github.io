Recordings and materials from all three of our SIGGRAPH 2025 sessions are now available! Whether you missed the events or want to revisit the content, you can now access everything from our hands-on lab, Birds of a Feather session, and neural shading course.

### Hands-On Class: Introduction to Slang

Our hands-on lab covered everything from language fundamentals to advanced features like modules, generics, and automatic differentiation. You can now work through the entire session at your own pace.

Download the lab materials and walk through the examples on your own computer here:\

### Neural Shading Course

Our intensive course on neural shading techniques provides a deep dive into the cutting edge of graphics programming, showing how to implement neural networks in Slang while leveraging automatic differentiation and modern GPU capabilities.

You can find the slides for this course, along with all example code in our repository, or watch the recordings:
