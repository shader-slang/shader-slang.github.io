Join us for an engaging hands-on session where we'll walk through creating your first Gaussian splat using Slang. Perfect for graphics programmers interested in getting started with neural techniques, this hands-on introduction will take you from installation through basic shader compilation to rendering your first splat.

## We'll cover everything you need to get started

- Setting up Slang for development
- Understanding the basics of Gaussian splats
- Writing and compiling your first Slang shader

<br>
This beginner-friendly session includes step-by-step code examples and demonstrations, with time for Q&A. By the end, you'll understand how to use Slang and be ready to explore the training process.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of computer graphics concepts
- Familiarity with shader or kernel programming languages (HLSL, GLSL, etc)
- No prior Slang or Gaussian splatting experience required
- Optional: Have Slang compiler installed if you want to follow along  

## Speakers

- Shannon Woods, Slang Working Group Chair. NVIDIA.
