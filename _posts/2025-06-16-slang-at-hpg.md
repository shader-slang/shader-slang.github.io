We're excited to announce that Slang will be presented at [**High-Performance Graphics (HPG) 2025 in Copenhagen**](https://www.highperformancegraphics.org/2025/index.html)! Our presentation, part of the Hot 3D track, will demonstrate how Slang's automatic differentiation capabilities are making neural graphics techniques more accessible to real-time graphics developers.

## Why This Matters

Neural techniques like Gaussian splatting and learned materials are delivering unprecedented visual quality, but implementing them has traditionally meant juggling separate codebases in ML frameworks and graphics APIs. Slang changes this by bringing automatic differentiation directly to shader programming, enabling developers to implement gradient-based optimization without leaving their familiar graphics environment.

## Can't Make It?

Stay connected with Slang's neural graphics developments:

- Try our [2D Gaussian Splatting examples](https://github.com/shader-slang/slangpy-samples/tree/main/experiments/diff-splatting)  
- Experiment with [Slang in your browser](https://shader-slang.org/slang-playground/?demo=gsplat2d-diff)  
- Join us on the [Slang Discord](https://khr.io/slangdiscord)


We're looking forward to demonstrating how Slang is making neural graphics more accessible to everyone. See you at HPG 2025!
