In its second year, Graphics Programmaing Conference will have the latest advances in real-time rendering in games, interactive application and other new developments.

Slang Working Group Chair, Shannong Woods will be speaking on Slang, the open-source, cross-platform shading language hosted by Khronos Group. This presentation explores how Slang's modern features enable neural graphics techniques across diverse GPU platforms. We will examine Slang's key architectural advantages: its modular system for scalable shader development, built-in automatic differentiation capabilities, and seamless cross-platform compilation. We will explore Slang's automatic differentiation system, enabling gradient-based optimization without requiring external ML frameworks. By understanding Slang's language design and capabilities, graphics programmers can leverage its neural graphics features to build more sophisticated and performant shader systems, unlocking new possibilities in real-time rendering across all target platforms.
