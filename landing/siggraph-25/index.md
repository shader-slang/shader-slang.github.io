# Slang at SIGGRAPH 2025

# Course: Introduction to Neural Shading

This is the landing page for the SIGGRAPH 2025 Course "Introduction to Neural Shading". You will find source code and other accompanying materials with the course here as they become available.

The latest release of Slang for SIGGRAPH can be found here https://github.com/shader-slang/slang/releases/tag/v2025.14.2

## [Hands-On Class: Introduction to Slang](https://s2025.conference-schedule.org/?post_type=page&p=14&id=gensubcur_104&sess=sess287)

**Sunday, August 10, 4:00-5:30 PM PDT**  
**West Building, Rooms 121-122**

Join us for an introductory lab for the Slang shading language, covering topics from language basics to advanced features like generics and automatic differentiation.

This lab also includes a few small projects and coding puzzles so you can try out what is presented, using a new shader editor built for this lab! We also demo how Slang works with debuggers like RenderDoc, and port a GLSL shader live.

## [Birds of a Feather: Developing with Slang](https://s2025.conference-schedule.org/?post_type=page&p=14&id=bof_177&sess=sess558)

**Wednesday, August 13, 2:30-3:30 PM PDT**  
**British Ballroom, Fairmont Waterfront**

This community-focused session will provide the latest updates on Slang development and foster discussions about the future of shader programming.

## [An Introduction to Neural Shading](https://s2025.conference-schedule.org/?post_type=page&p=14&id=gensub_420&sess=sess208)

**Thursday, August 14, 9:00 AM-12:15 PM PDT**  
**West Building, Rooms 109-110**

This intensive course will teach you how to implement neural shading techniques using Slang, where traditional graphics algorithms are replaced with neural networks.
