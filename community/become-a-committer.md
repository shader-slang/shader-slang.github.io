# Become a Slang Committer

Becoming a committer is a significant step, as it gives you direct access to the repository, enabling you to merge changes, review code, and help shape the future of the project. Below are the expectations and process for becoming a committer in Slang.

## Show Consistent Contribution Quality
Your journey to becoming a committer starts with consistent, high-quality contributions to the Slang codebase. This typically includes:

Frequent, Meaningful Contributions: Regularly submit contributions, whether they are features, bug fixes, or performance improvements. Each contribution should align with Slang’s goals and maintain the bar of code quality.
High-Impact Contributions: Aim to contribute changes that significantly benefit the project, such as optimizations, core feature enhancements, or critical bug fixes. Contributions that demonstrate a deep understanding of Slang’s architecture and design are highly valued.

## Engage in Code Reviews
In open-source projects, reviewing others’ code is as important as submitting your own. Before becoming a committer, you should:

**Participate in Code Reviews:** Actively participate in code reviews by providing insightful feedback. Look for issues in logic, style, performance, and alignment with Slang’s objectives.

**Help Raise the Code Quality:** Encourage adherence to Slang’s standards and practices by providing constructive feedback. The ability to review others’ code with a critical yet supportive approach is essential for committers.

## Build Trust and Collaboration
Committer status is granted based on the trust that you are deeply committed to Slang’s success. You can demonstrate this by:

**Being Reliable and Responsive:** Maintain a regular and responsive presence in the project, whether in pull requests, discussions, or reviews.

**Work Well with Others:** Slang is a community effort, so committers are expected to work well with other contributors, listen to feedback, and adapt where needed.

**Take Ownership of Work:** Show a sense of responsibility by following up on contributions and addressing issues that arise in areas of the code you’ve worked on.

## Demonstrate Technical Understanding of Slang
To maintain and develop the Slang codebase, committers need a comprehensive understanding of its internals. Demonstrate that you:

**Understand Slang’s Architecture:** Learn and follow Slang’s core architecture, coding patterns, and design principles.

**Know the Shading Language and Compiler Space:** Familiarize yourself with shading languages and compilers in general. This domain knowledge helps you contribute effectively and make informed decisions as a committer.

## Maintain a Record of High-Quality Contributions
Consistent quality and dedication are key criteria. Committers typically have:

**A History of Reviewed Contributions:** Have at least 10 high-quality patches merged, with a record of thorough and constructive review feedback.

**Positive Reviewer Feedback:** Accumulate reviews from existing committers that acknowledge your contribution quality and readiness.

## The Committer Nomination Process

Once you meet the criteria above, you can nominate yourself to become a committer. This process includes:

**Nomination:** You can ask a committer to nominate you to become a committer via our discord channel.

**Internal Review:** Existing committers will review your contributions, code review feedback, and responsiveness to determine your readiness.

**Final Approval:** Upon a positive consensus, you will be granted committer status along with write access to the Slang repository.

Becoming a committer is a meaningful responsibility, and we value contributors who are invested in maintaining and advancing Slang. Thank you for your continued contributions, and we look forward to welcoming you as a committer!
